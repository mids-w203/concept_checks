# Running this demo

This is a shiny app. In order to run it, open either `ui.R` or `server.R` in Rstudio. Then, click the `> Run App` button that is shown in the upper-right of the code editing window. 

If you've been working principally on the datahub, then you will have to upload these files onto the datahub and then open the files and click the `> Run App` button.
